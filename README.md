# 📘 Library Management

This project was a **semester-grade** assignment and the result of **4 months of work**.

In this project, I focused on providing the user **flexibility** to enter characters and strings for various inputs, such as **dates, prices,** and **ISBNs**.

Throughout the project, I encountered many challenges, especially with **string handling**. Managing spaces between characters can be difficult—especially when handling **books with similar starting characters**. Ensuring smooth input and search functionality was a key challenge I worked to overcome.
